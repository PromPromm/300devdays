# 300 Dev Days Code Repository

Welcome to the 300 Dev Days Code Repository! This repository is dedicated to sharing the source code for the classes and projects covered during the entire duration of the 300 Dev Days program. The goal is to create a space where participants can access and learn from the codebase.

## About the Program

300 Dev Days is an immersive training program designed to equip African youths with comprehensive skills in both frontend and backend development. The program aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by offering a dynamic curriculum, hands-on projects, and live workshops.

## Structure of the Repository

This repository is organized into folders corresponding to the different classes and projects covered during the 300 Dev Days program. Each folder contains the source code, documentation, and any additional resources related to the respective class or project.



Feel free to explore the folders to find the materials for specific classes or projects.

## How to Use
If you find this structure appealing and wish to adopt it for your own notes or explore it for tips and practice, you can follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. In your terminal, navigate to the directory you want to on your computer e.g `cd ~/300devdays`
3. Clone the repo from your personal GitHub into the directory
4. CD into the cloned directory: `cd 300devdays`
5. Add an upstream, which links to this GitHub repo: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/PromPromm/300devdays`
6. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`.
7. Make your modifications, stage and commit the changes:
   - Stage your changes on git by adding them: 
     `git add .` or `git add file-name`
   - Then commit the staged changes:
     `git commit -m 'Add your message here'`
8. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature`.
9. "At this stage, you might typically generate a pull request on GitHub, but kindly refrain from doing so. Merging everyone's individual notes is unnecessary."
10. Update your workflow with my weekly updates by following these steps in order:  
    - Move into main:  
        `git checkout main`
    - Update main with changes from my GitHub repo (upstream):  
        `git pull upstream main`
    - Push my changes to your forked GitHub repo (origin), for online storage:  
        `git push origin main`
    - Move into your named branch:  
        `git checkout branchname`
    - Update your named branch with changes from main:  
        `git merge main`
    - Make any changes you want to, then return to Steps 7 & 8.
